I am building a scalable, user-friendly web scraping platform with a React PWA frontend, a Python/Node.js backend, and support for Scrapy and Playwright for scraping. The frontend features a visual selector tool that allows users to interact with a sandboxed iframe, capturing CSS selectors/XPaths, zooming in/out, and defining link-following rules. The backend dynamically determines whether a page requires JavaScript execution, using Cheerio for static pages and Playwright in headless mode for dynamic content. The system stores workflows in MongoDB and structured data in PostgreSQL, while supporting user authentication for scraping protected content and proxy rotation for anonymity.

I want to optimize performance, usability, and security. Improve the iFrame experience by enabling lazy loading, SSR (Next.js), and gesture-based zoom/pan for touchscreen navigation. Enhance PWA capabilities using Workbox caching, offline mode, and bulk element selection with drag gestures. On the backend, introduce browser pooling for Playwright, retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, and adaptive rendering selection to switch between Cheerio and Playwright dynamically. Implement parallel execution for Scrapy jobs using Dask or Ray, add Celery or Redis-based task queues, and refine proxy management with dynamic scoring and auto-fallback to different providers.

For data handling, add workflow versioning with rollback, diff-based comparisons, and improve database performance by using PostgreSQL partitions and vector search indexing (pgvector/Qdrant) for semantic search. Strengthen authentication and security by integrating stealth.js for browser fingerprint evasion, allowing encrypted credential storage for protected logins, and enforcing Content Security Policy (CSP) with Subresource Integrity (SRI) to secure the iframe environment. Improve deployment and user experience by offering one-click Docker deployment (auto-generated compose files), a CLI tool for local scraper management, and real-time usage analytics to track quotas.

To scale long-term, transition to a microservices architecture, splitting Playwright/Scrapy workers into isolated services communicating via gRPC instead of REST. Implement Cloudflare Workers or Fastly Edge Functions to cache frequent scraper requests and reduce load times. The goal is to enhance efficiency, resilience against anti-scraping mechanisms, and user experience while maintaining scalability.
